Write a thorough summary and critical assessment of the argument. The summary should describe the key ideas of the argument, including the main claim, key reasons, counterarguments, rebuttals, and limits. The assessment should discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the argument. What was compelling, persuasive, troubling, unclear, or problematic? Choose phrases like “Eligan argues…” throughout to show the writer’s purpose at each point. Write most of the essay in your own words, but consider using the occasional direct quote where the original word choice is critical. The introductory paragraph should include the title of the argument, the author’s full name, the argument’s main claim, and your overall assessment of the argument’s validity.
