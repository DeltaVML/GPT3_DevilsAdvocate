Write a thorough summary and critical assessment of the argument. The summary should focus on the following point: "<<POINT>>" Your assessment of this point should discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the argument. What was compelling, persuasive, troubling, unclear, or problematic? Choose phrases like “Eligan argues…” throughout to show the writer’s purpose at each point. Write most of the essay in your own words, but consider using the occasional direct quote where the original word choice is critical.
