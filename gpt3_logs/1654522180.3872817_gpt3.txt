"Title: ""Wouldn’t We All Cross the Border?"" by Anna Mills

All the disagreement over immigration policy I have been hearing about in the news lately reminds me that while I believe in the rule of law, I feel profoundly uncomfortable with the idea of keeping people out who are desperate to come in. Is illegal immigration actually wrong? Is it unethical to cross a border without permission?

I don’t have a clear vision yet of what the right border policy would be, and I admit that completely open borders would put our security at risk. But surely there are ways to regulate the border without criminalizing people who are driven by need and good intentions.

If I were raising children in an impoverished third-world community plagued by violence, and if I had a chance to get my family to the U.S., I would take it. I would try to cross a border illegally so my children would get enough to eat and would have a more stable childhood and a chance at a better education and a better career. What parent would sit on their hands and tell themself, “I want to give my child a better life, but oh well. If I don’t have the papers, I guess it would be wrong”?

If most of us, under desperate circumstances, would cross the border without permission and feel no moral qualms about doing so, then we must recognize this crossing as an ethical, reasonable act. If it is ethical and reasonable, then how can either a wall or a detention center be on the side of justice? We must find a policy that treats migrants as we would want to be treated--with empathy, respect, and offers of help.

THOROUGH ASSESSMENT of STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES:

==========

RESPONSE:

Eligan argues that the current debate over immigration policy is based on a false dichotomy--either one believes in the rule of law or one believes in helping those in need. The author first States their belief in the rule of law, but then immediately questions it.

The strength of this argument is its ability to provoke critical thinking about a complex issue. The author challenges the reader to consider whether the current system is just, and whether there might be another way to balance security concerns with the needs of migrants.

A weakness of the argument is that it does not offer concrete solutions to the complex problem of immigration. The author relies too heavily on hypothetical scenarios, which makes the argument feel less persuasive. Another weakness is the author’s assumption that most people would break the law if they were in a desperate situation. This is not necessarily true, and it oversimplifies the issue.
