Write a thorough summary and critical assessment of the argument. The summary should describe the key ideas of the argument, including the main claim, key reasons, counterarguments, rebuttals, and limits. The assessment should discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the argument. What was compelling, persuasive, troubling, unclear, or problematic? Choose phrases like “Eligan argues…” throughout to show the writer’s purpose at each point. Write most of the essay in your own words, but consider using the occasional direct quote where the original word choice is critical. The introductory paragraph should include the title of the argument, the author’s full name, the argument’s main claim, and your overall assessment of the argument’s validity.



"Title: ""Wouldn’t We All Cross the Border?"" by Anna Mills

All the disagreement over immigration policy I have been hearing about in the news lately reminds me that while I believe in the rule of law, I feel profoundly uncomfortable with the idea of keeping people out who are desperate to come in. Is illegal immigration actually wrong? Is it unethical to cross a border without permission?

I don’t have a clear vision yet of what the right border policy would be, and I admit that completely open borders would put our security at risk. But surely there are ways to regulate the border without criminalizing people who are driven by need and good intentions.

If I were raising children in an impoverished third-world community plagued by violence, and if I had a chance to get my family to the U.S., I would take it. I would try to cross a border illegally so my children would get enough to eat and would have a more stable childhood and a chance at a better education and a better career. What parent would sit on their hands and tell themself, “I want to give my child a better life, but oh well. If I don’t have the papers, I guess it would be wrong”?

If most of us, under desperate circumstances, would cross the border without permission and feel no moral qualms about doing so, then we must recognize this crossing as an ethical, reasonable act. If it is ethical and reasonable, then how can either a wall or a detention center be on the side of justice? We must find a policy that treats migrants as we would want to be treated--with empathy, respect, and offers of help.

SUMMARY AND CRITICAL ASSESSMENT:

==========

RESPONSE:

Anna Mills argues that illegal immigration is not unethical, and that we should find a policy that treats migrants with empathy and respect. She points out that many people would cross a border without permission if they were in desperate circumstances, and argues that this crossing is an ethical and reasonable act. The strength of Mills' argument is that she provides a compelling ethical perspective on illegal immigration. Her argument that we should treat migrants with empathy and respect is persuasive, and her hypothetical situation is relatable. However, Mills' argument is limited in that it does not address some of the practical concerns around illegal immigration, such as security risks. Overall, Mills makes a compelling case that illegal immigration is not necessarily unethical, and that we should approach the issue with more empathy.
