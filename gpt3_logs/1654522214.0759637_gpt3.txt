PROMPT:

Write a thorough summary and critical assessment of the argument. The summary should focus on the following point: "- The author then argues that if most people would cross the border illegally under desperate circumstances, then we must recognize this crossing as an ethical, reasonable act." Your assessment of this point should discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the argument. What was compelling, persuasive, troubling, unclear, or problematic? Choose phrases like “Eligan argues…” throughout to show the writer’s purpose at each point. Write most of the essay in your own words, but consider using the occasional direct quote where the original word choice is critical.



"Title: ""Wouldn’t We All Cross the Border?"" by Anna Mills

All the disagreement over immigration policy I have been hearing about in the news lately reminds me that while I believe in the rule of law, I feel profoundly uncomfortable with the idea of keeping people out who are desperate to come in. Is illegal immigration actually wrong? Is it unethical to cross a border without permission?

I don’t have a clear vision yet of what the right border policy would be, and I admit that completely open borders would put our security at risk. But surely there are ways to regulate the border without criminalizing people who are driven by need and good intentions.

If I were raising children in an impoverished third-world community plagued by violence, and if I had a chance to get my family to the U.S., I would take it. I would try to cross a border illegally so my children would get enough to eat and would have a more stable childhood and a chance at a better education and a better career. What parent would sit on their hands and tell themself, “I want to give my child a better life, but oh well. If I don’t have the papers, I guess it would be wrong”?

If most of us, under desperate circumstances, would cross the border without permission and feel no moral qualms about doing so, then we must recognize this crossing as an ethical, reasonable act. If it is ethical and reasonable, then how can either a wall or a detention center be on the side of justice? We must find a policy that treats migrants as we would want to be treated--with empathy, respect, and offers of help.

THOROUGH ASSESSMENT of STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES:

==========

RESPONSE:

The author's argument is compelling in its appeal to empathy and reason. It is reasonable to think that, if faced with desperate circumstances, most people would try to cross a border illegally in order to provide a better life for their children. The author's use of personal pronouns ("I would try to cross a border illegally so my children would get enough to eat") is effective in driving home this point.

However, the argument is somewhat weakened by its lack of specificity. The author does not provide concrete examples of how a more open border policy could work in practice. Additionally, the use of personal pronouns throughout the essay gives the impression that the author is speaking from a position of privilege (for example, "If I were raising children in an impoverished third-world community plagued by violence").
