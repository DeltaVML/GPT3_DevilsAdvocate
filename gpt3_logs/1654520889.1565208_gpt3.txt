"Title: ""Wouldn’t We All Cross the Border?"" by Anna Mills

All the disagreement over immigration policy I have been hearing about in the news lately reminds me that while I believe in the rule of law, I feel profoundly uncomfortable with the idea of keeping people out who are desperate to come in. Is illegal immigration actually wrong? Is it unethical to cross a border without permission?

I don’t have a clear vision yet of what the right border policy would be, and I admit that completely open borders would put our security at risk. But surely there are ways to regulate the border without criminalizing people who are driven by need and good intentions.

If I were raising children in an impoverished third-world community plagued by violence, and if I had a chance to get my family to the U.S., I would take it. I would try to cross a border illegally so my children would get enough to eat and would have a more stable childhood and a chance at a better education and a better career. What parent would sit on their hands and tell themself, “I want to give my child a better life, but oh well. If I don’t have the papers, I guess it would be wrong”?

If most of us, under desperate circumstances, would cross the border without permission and feel no moral qualms about doing so, then we must recognize this crossing as an ethical, reasonable act. If it is ethical and reasonable, then how can either a wall or a detention center be on the side of justice? We must find a policy that treats migrants as we would want to be treated--with empathy, respect, and offers of help.

THOROUGH ASSESSMENT of STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES:

==========

RESPONSE:

Eligan argues that people who cross the border without permission should not be criminalized, as they are driven by need and good intentions. She concedes that open borders would pose a security risk, but argues that there must be a way to regulate the border without criminalizing migrants. The strength of this argument is its appeal to empathy and common sense. If most of us would cross the border illegally if we were in the same desperate circumstances, then surely we should not criminalize those who do so. This is a persuasive argument that could lead to changes in policy. A weakness of the argument is that it does not address the potential negative consequences of illegal immigration, such as overcrowding, strain on resources, and crime. It also does not offer a detailed solution for how to regulate the border. Eligan’s appeal to empathy is powerful, but it would be strengthened by a more systematic examination of the issue.
