"Title: ""Wouldn’t We All Cross the Border?"" by Anna Mills

All the disagreement over immigration policy I have been hearing about in the news lately reminds me that while I believe in the rule of law, I feel profoundly uncomfortable with the idea of keeping people out who are desperate to come in. Is illegal immigration actually wrong? Is it unethical to cross a border without permission?

I don’t have a clear vision yet of what the right border policy would be, and I admit that completely open borders would put our security at risk. But surely there are ways to regulate the border without criminalizing people who are driven by need and good intentions.

If I were raising children in an impoverished third-world community plagued by violence, and if I had a chance to get my family to the U.S., I would take it. I would try to cross a border illegally so my children would get enough to eat and would have a more stable childhood and a chance at a better education and a better career. What parent would sit on their hands and tell themself, “I want to give my child a better life, but oh well. If I don’t have the papers, I guess it would be wrong”?

If most of us, under desperate circumstances, would cross the border without permission and feel no moral qualms about doing so, then we must recognize this crossing as an ethical, reasonable act. If it is ethical and reasonable, then how can either a wall or a detention center be on the side of justice? We must find a policy that treats migrants as we would want to be treated--with empathy, respect, and offers of help.

THOROUGH ASSESSMENT of STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES:

RESPONSE:

Mills' argument is compelling in its recognition of the desperation that often drives people to illegal immigration. She also echoes a sentiment that many people can likely relate to - that of wanting to do whatever is necessary to provide a better life for one's children. However, Mills does not provide clear solutions to the problems she raises and her argument is ultimately quite idealistic. She does not acknowledge the security risks that come with completely open borders, for example. Additionally, Mills paints all immigrants with the same brush, suggesting that they are all driven by need and good intentions. But this is clearly not always the case - some people do come to the US with bad intentions. Overall, Mills raises some valid points, but her argument is somewhat simplistic and lacking in practical solutions.
