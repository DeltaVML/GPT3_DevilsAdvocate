"Title: ""Wouldn’t We All Cross the Border?"" by Anna Mills

All the disagreement over immigration policy I have been hearing about in the news lately reminds me that while I believe in the rule of law, I feel profoundly uncomfortable with the idea of keeping people out who are desperate to come in. Is illegal immigration actually wrong? Is it unethical to cross a border without permission?

I don’t have a clear vision yet of what the right border policy would be, and I admit that completely open borders would put our security at risk. But surely there are ways to regulate the border without criminalizing people who are driven by need and good intentions.

If I were raising children in an impoverished third-world community plagued by violence, and if I had a chance to get my family to the U.S., I would take it. I would try to cross a border illegally so my children would get enough to eat and would have a more stable childhood and a chance at a better education and a better career. What parent would sit on their hands and tell themself, “I want to give my child a better life, but oh well. If I don’t have the papers, I guess it would be wrong”?

If most of us, under desperate circumstances, would cross the border without permission and feel no moral qualms about doing so, then we must recognize this crossing as an ethical, reasonable act. If it is ethical and reasonable, then how can either a wall or a detention center be on the side of justice? We must find a policy that treats migrants as we would want to be treated--with empathy, respect, and offers of help.

THOROUGH ASSESSMENT and EVALUATION:

==========

RESPONSE:

"Wouldn't We All Cross the Border?" by Anna Mills is an argument in favor of more empathy and better treatment of migrants, particularly those who cross borders illegally. Mills begins by admitting that she is not sure what the "right" border policy would be, but she is sure that current policies are criminalizing people who are often desperate and have good intentions. She argues that if she were in a similar position to many migrants - coming from an impoverished background with little opportunity - she would also cross the border illegally in order to give her children a better life. Therefore, Mills concludes that illegal border crossers should be treated with empathy, respect, and help, not criminalization.

This is a persuasive argument that is based on empathy and personal experience. The author's story about what she would do in the same position as many migrants is particularly effective in making her case. However, the argument relies heavily on emotion and does not provide much in the way of concrete solutions. In addition, the author does not address the potential security risks of completely open borders. Overall, this is a thought-provoking piece that offers a different perspective on the issue of immigration.
