"Title: ""Wouldn’t We All Cross the Border?"" by Anna Mills

All the disagreement over immigration policy I have been hearing about in the news lately reminds me that while I believe in the rule of law, I feel profoundly uncomfortable with the idea of keeping people out who are desperate to come in. Is illegal immigration actually wrong? Is it unethical to cross a border without permission?

I don’t have a clear vision yet of what the right border policy would be, and I admit that completely open borders would put our security at risk. But surely there are ways to regulate the border without criminalizing people who are driven by need and good intentions.

If I were raising children in an impoverished third-world community plagued by violence, and if I had a chance to get my family to the U.S., I would take it. I would try to cross a border illegally so my children would get enough to eat and would have a more stable childhood and a chance at a better education and a better career. What parent would sit on their hands and tell themself, “I want to give my child a better life, but oh well. If I don’t have the papers, I guess it would be wrong”?

If most of us, under desperate circumstances, would cross the border without permission and feel no moral qualms about doing so, then we must recognize this crossing as an ethical, reasonable act. If it is ethical and reasonable, then how can either a wall or a detention center be on the side of justice? We must find a policy that treats migrants as we would want to be treated--with empathy, respect, and offers of help.

THOROUGH ASSESSMENT and EVALUATION:

==========

RESPONSE:

In her argument, "Wouldn't We All Cross the Border?", Anna Mills claims that if most of us were in the same desperate circumstances as many migrants are, we would try to cross a border illegally too. Therefore, she argues that illegal immigration is not wrong or unethical, and that we should find a policy that treats migrants with empathy, respect, and offers of help. Mills' argument is compelling in that she speaks to the human element of immigration. Her argument is also persuasive in that she uses hypothetical scenarios to illustrate her point. However, her argument is limited in that it does not address the larger issue of immigration policy and how to regulate the border. Additionally, her argument does not take into account the potential security risks of completely open borders. Overall, Mills' argument is thought-provoking and highlights the need for compassion when considering immigration policy.
