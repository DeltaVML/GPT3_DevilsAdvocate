"Title: ""Wouldn’t We All Cross the Border?"" by Anna Mills

All the disagreement over immigration policy I have been hearing about in the news lately reminds me that while I believe in the rule of law, I feel profoundly uncomfortable with the idea of keeping people out who are desperate to come in. Is illegal immigration actually wrong? Is it unethical to cross a border without permission?

I don’t have a clear vision yet of what the right border policy would be, and I admit that completely open borders would put our security at risk. But surely there are ways to regulate the border without criminalizing people who are driven by need and good intentions.

If I were raising children in an impoverished third-world community plagued by violence, and if I had a chance to get my family to the U.S., I would take it. I would try to cross a border illegally so my children would get enough to eat and would have a more stable childhood and a chance at a better education and a better career. What parent would sit on their hands and tell themself, “I want to give my child a better life, but oh well. If I don’t have the papers, I guess it would be wrong”?

If most of us, under desperate circumstances, would cross the border without permission and feel no moral qualms about doing so, then we must recognize this crossing as an ethical, reasonable act. If it is ethical and reasonable, then how can either a wall or a detention center be on the side of justice? We must find a policy that treats migrants as we would want to be treated--with empathy, respect, and offers of help.

THOROUGH ASSESSMENT of STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES:

==========

RESPONSE:

Wouldn't We All Cross the Border by Anna Mills is an article that argues that illegal immigration is not wrong and that people who are driven by need and good intentions should not be criminalized.

The strength of this argument is that it is based on empathy and understanding. The author points out that if they were in a desperate situation, they would themselves try to cross the border illegally in order to give their children a better life. This highlights the importance of treating migrants with respect and understanding, as they are simply trying to improve their lives and the lives of their families.

However, the argument also has some weaknesses. Firstly, the author does not provide any concrete solutions to the issue of immigration. They simply state that the current system is unfair and that there must be a better way to regulate the border. Secondly, the author does not address the potential security risks that come with completely open borders. This leaves the reader wondering how exactly the author envisages this policy change being implemented.
