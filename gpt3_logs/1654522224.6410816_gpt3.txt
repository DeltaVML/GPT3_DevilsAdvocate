"Title: ""Wouldn’t We All Cross the Border?"" by Anna Mills

All the disagreement over immigration policy I have been hearing about in the news lately reminds me that while I believe in the rule of law, I feel profoundly uncomfortable with the idea of keeping people out who are desperate to come in. Is illegal immigration actually wrong? Is it unethical to cross a border without permission?

I don’t have a clear vision yet of what the right border policy would be, and I admit that completely open borders would put our security at risk. But surely there are ways to regulate the border without criminalizing people who are driven by need and good intentions.

If I were raising children in an impoverished third-world community plagued by violence, and if I had a chance to get my family to the U.S., I would take it. I would try to cross a border illegally so my children would get enough to eat and would have a more stable childhood and a chance at a better education and a better career. What parent would sit on their hands and tell themself, “I want to give my child a better life, but oh well. If I don’t have the papers, I guess it would be wrong”?

If most of us, under desperate circumstances, would cross the border without permission and feel no moral qualms about doing so, then we must recognize this crossing as an ethical, reasonable act. If it is ethical and reasonable, then how can either a wall or a detention center be on the side of justice? We must find a policy that treats migrants as we would want to be treated--with empathy, respect, and offers of help.

THOROUGH ASSESSMENT of STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES:

==========

RESPONSE:

Wouldn't We All Cross the Border? by Anna Mills is an argument in favor of more humane immigration policies. The author points out that many people who are critical of illegal immigration would likely do the same if they were in the same desperate circumstances as those who are currently migrating. The author concludes by saying that we must find a policy that treats migrants with empathy, respect, and offers of help.

One strength of this argument is that it is based on empathy. The author imagines herself in the position of someone who is struggling to make a better life for her family. This makes it easier for readers to understand and empathize with the author's position.

A weakness of this argument is that it does not fully consider the security risks of open borders. The author acknowledges that open borders would be a security risk, but does not provide any solutions to this problem.

Overall, this is a persuasive argument for more humane immigration policies. It is based on empathy and provides a potential solution to the problem of security risks.
