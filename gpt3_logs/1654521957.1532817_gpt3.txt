"Title: ""Wouldn’t We All Cross the Border?"" by Anna Mills

All the disagreement over immigration policy I have been hearing about in the news lately reminds me that while I believe in the rule of law, I feel profoundly uncomfortable with the idea of keeping people out who are desperate to come in. Is illegal immigration actually wrong? Is it unethical to cross a border without permission?

I don’t have a clear vision yet of what the right border policy would be, and I admit that completely open borders would put our security at risk. But surely there are ways to regulate the border without criminalizing people who are driven by need and good intentions.

If I were raising children in an impoverished third-world community plagued by violence, and if I had a chance to get my family to the U.S., I would take it. I would try to cross a border illegally so my children would get enough to eat and would have a more stable childhood and a chance at a better education and a better career. What parent would sit on their hands and tell themself, “I want to give my child a better life, but oh well. If I don’t have the papers, I guess it would be wrong”?

If most of us, under desperate circumstances, would cross the border without permission and feel no moral qualms about doing so, then we must recognize this crossing as an ethical, reasonable act. If it is ethical and reasonable, then how can either a wall or a detention center be on the side of justice? We must find a policy that treats migrants as we would want to be treated--with empathy, respect, and offers of help.

THOROUGH ASSESSMENT of STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES:

==========

RESPONSE:

The strength of Anna Mills' argument is its compassionate perspective. She posits that if most people were in the same desperate circumstances as those who illegally cross the border into the United States, they would likely do the same. This hypothetical situation asks readers to put themselves in the shoes of someone who is suffering, and to imagine what they would do to relieve that suffering. This is a strong emotional appeal that can be quite persuasive. The weakness of the argument is that it does not present any concrete solutions to the problem of immigration. Instead, it relies on readers to draw their own conclusions about what the "right" border policy would be. Furthermore, the argument does not adequately address the security concerns that come with completely open borders. While Mills concedes that this would be a problem, she does not offer any solutions to address it.
